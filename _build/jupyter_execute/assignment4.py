Pure Nickel with grain size of 100 Âµm was used for a turbine blade. Creep rupture
data (see table below) was used to construct Larson-Miller plot (see figure) for this
alloy, assuming $C$=20.



## Tasks

**a.**  Which quantity or quantities can be predicted by LM parameter?<br>

**b.**  Which information does the Larson-Miller concept provide about the creep mechanism?<br>

**c.**  Estimate the expected life for a sample tested at 650 $^oC$ with a stress of 240 MPa, and at 870 $^oC$ with a stress of 35 MPa. Compare these values with actual test results of 32000 and 9000 hr, respectively and explain the difference.<br>

**d.**  What is the max. operational temperature such that failure should not occur in 5000 hr at stress levels of 140 and 200 MPa, respectively.<br>

**e.**  Theoretically what can be done to improve the lifetime ($t_{R}$) of this material? Provide at least two improvements.<br>
